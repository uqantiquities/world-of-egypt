## The Afterlife

In addition to coffin and tomb decorations, votive objects such as Shabtis, were placed in the burial chamber to assist the deceased in the Afterlife. 

## Shabti for Wedja Hor

Shabtis were a very common funerary item in ancient Egypt and were servants for the deceased in the Afterlife. 

This Late Period shabti is made of pale green faience, a common Egyptian material that is produce similarly to ceramic but has a glass-like shine and quality. 

The shabti depicts a male figure in mummiform, wearing a tripartite wig and beard, and his arms are crossed over the chest in the conventional manner. In his hands are a mattock, hoe, and basket. These items are associated with farming/agriculture work and suggest that the deceased would use their shabti to work their plot of land in the Afterlife 

Hieroglyphics have been inscribed in three vertical panels down the legs, reading: 

### Oh, these shabtis, if one counts off the Osiris Wedja-Hor, born of Ast-em-Khebit, to do every work (in) the god's land - 'here I am', [you] shall say.
