This stop concludes your tour. In this audio tour, we have explored the world of Ancient Egypt and discovered what archaeological material can tell us about this great civilisation. Religious artefacts provide insight into the gods and goddesses of Egyptian religion and how these divinities were worshipped in the ancient world. Death and mummification are prominent features of the collection, reflecting the Egyptian preoccupation with proper burial. The region was also very important to the Romans and the domination of this empire over North Africa changed ancient Egypt.  

Thank you for joining us at the R.D. Milns Antiquities Museum.

Please wait at this final stop for further instructions from your tour guide about how to return your iPads and headphones.
