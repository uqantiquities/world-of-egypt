## Egyptian Afterlife 

For the ancient Egyptians the afterlife, or Field of Rushes, was a reflection of the real world they had left. The dead were granted a plot of land that they were expected to work and maintain. Shabtis were servants, mummiform figurines meant to perform manual labour in the afterlife. This allowed the deceased to pursue leisure activities such as hunting. Shabtis were placed in tombs, and are often depicted with agricultural implements such as picks, hoes and baskets, so that they could fulfil their role as farm labourers.

We aren’t sure exactly where the name “shabti” comes from, but it is possible that they are named after either the Egyptian word for “stick” (reflecting their stick-like form) or after the word for “answer” (because shabits answer the call of their master). Both terms sound a bit like “shabti”.

Shabtis were mostly made out of faience, a mixture of crushed quartz or sand with glass, which could be worked much like pottery and covered in a glaze. Faience was widely used for small objects such as beads, amulets, and shabtis, as well as for cups, bowls, and decorative tiles.

From the New Kingdom onwards, kings and important officials were supplied with shabtis in considerable numbers. They varied greatly in material, size, and inscriptions, but could be incredibly detailed in design and decoration and were usually inscribed. This shabti is made of brown faience and is inscribed in Egyptian hieroglyphs down the front. The inscription reads: 

# The illuminated one, the Osiris Pa-di Bastet. 

Pa-di Bastet was the name of the deceased and is associated with Bastet, the Egyptian cat-headed goddess of the home, fertility, and childbirth.
