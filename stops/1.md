## Em Hotep! Welcome! 

Egyptian civilisation flourished for over three thousand years along the valley of the River Nile in north eastern Africa. Egypt was ruled by hereditary dynasties of kings called pharaohs, who were thought to be gods themselves. At its greatest extent in the New Kingdom, the Egyptian civilisation reached from Alexandria on the Mediterranean Sea in the north, to Nubia in the south, and from the deserts of Libya in the west, to Sinai and the Levant in the East. 

At the heart of this territory was the River Nile which provided transport, fertility to the land, and inspiration for the myths, legends and religious practices of the ancient Egyptians. By the end of the first century BC, Egyptâ€™s power and influence had declined and it came under the control of successive dynasties of Persians, Greeks and Romans. 

Significant changes occurred in Egypt under these foreign rulers, but Egypt also influenced her new rulers.
