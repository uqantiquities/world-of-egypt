This is a special kind of wine mixing bowl called a Volute Krater, but it was probably never used to mix wine. 

Instead it was used to mark a grave in the Greek areas of Southern Italy in about 330 BC and is decorated in a style called the "Red Figure" technique, due to the colour of the figures on a black background. 

The red-figure scenes are typical funerary images with the naiskos (funerary temple) scene on the front depicting Hades and a judge of the Underworld. 

The vase has been re-assembled from numerous fragments with some infilling. 

Function: Used for mixing wine and water at symposia, but this type was made for funerary purposes.
